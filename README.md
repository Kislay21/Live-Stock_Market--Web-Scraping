# Live-Stock_Market--Web-Scraping
Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. The web scraping software may directly access the World Wide Web using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.

In this repository, we have scraped the Live news section from the website of "The Economic Times".

We have used requests, BeautifulSoup and bs4 libraries to scrape the content. As the website gets updated with the latest news, it is also updated in the python file.
